# Sensitive Data Filtering API

This repository is dedicated to improving the learning experience in the Go programming language.

The main objective of this repository is to develop a user-friendly API that effectively filters out sensitive information from JSON objects. By utilizing this API, users can confidently send JSON data, knowing that any sensitive data will be securely removed.

The filtering process will identify and exclude sensitive data fields, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of the information.

This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (POC), showcasing the capabilities and potential of learning enhancements and sensitive data filtering in Go.
